* Maintains relationships defined on the database and application levels
* Supports fine-tuning of resulting data set
* Reduces time and cost of test data provisioning
* Integrates into CI/CD processes via rich REST API
* Controls privacy vs. utility trade-off via privacy budget
* Can increase test data variability and volume
* Utilizes distributed, fault-tolerant Apache Spark cluster
